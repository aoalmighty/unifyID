Hey there!

I am Ashraf Omar, looking for an internship position at UnifyID. Here is the iOS application that I have designed for this challenge.

Challenges Faced:

I do not have an active developer's account and testing proved to be very challenging. The xCode simulator does not support a camera so I could not test the product as I did the challenge.

I have never designed an application that requires a camera function. 
I started with the UIImagePicker and soon realize it could not take multiple pictures. So I spend the first hour or so looking up tutorials on AVFoundation and AVCaptureDevice, to have more control over the camera.

Capturing the the require number of images, within the specified time interval (0.5s), was done using timers.

The second difficulty I had was to encrypt the images. As I had spent many hours learning as I progress through the challenge, there was little time left. I resorted to opensource of which the built in encryption was used "dataUsingEncoding(NSUTF8StringEncoding)"

I found this challenge very interesting as I have learnt a lot through the process. I will continue to learn and hope to be able to contribute significantly to unifyID.

Thank you for taking the time to read and examine my work.
