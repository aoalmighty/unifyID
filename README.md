Hey there!

I am Ashraf Omar, looking for an internship position at UnifyID. Here is the iOS application that I have designed for this challenge.

The application takes 5 photos and securely saves them.

Challenges Faced:

Yhe xCode simulator does not support a camera so I could not test the product as I did the challenge. I do not have an active developer's account and testing proved to be very challenging. Thus, I am unsure if the application can actaully run, but I hope I will also be judged based on the code. This application was essential coded 'blindly', but I tried to make the best use of what I had.

I have never designed an application that requires a camera function. 
I started with the UIImagePicker and soon realize it could not take multiple pictures. So I spend the first hour or so looking up tutorials on AVFoundation and AVCaptureDevice, to have more control over the camera.

The second difficulty I had was to encrypt the images. As I had spent many hours learning as I progress through the challenge, there was little time left. I resorted to opensource of which the built in encryption was used "dataUsingEncoding(NSUTF8StringEncoding)"

I found this challenge very interesting as I have learnt a lot through the process. I will continue to learn and hope to be able to contribute significantly to unifyID.

Future ideas:

-More intuitive UI/UX
-Face Detection (image recognition)
-Auto-focus on face upon detection
-Clearer and well commented code(Due to time constraints)(Feel free to email if you need any clarification regarding the code)

I am sure that if I had more time, I can enhance the application.

Thank you for taking the time to read and examine my work. Do contact me at ao356@live.com to get in touch with me. Hope to hear from you soon.
